# Class Planner
Learning Angular by creating a planner to organize classes and assignments.

## Introduction

This project was started by following a youtube tutorial aimed around creating a note-taking app:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlXEeOk-MrI&list=PLIjdNHWULhPR5cr7nkTvq6kTV8rbr6BVz>

The tutorial was used to create the basic functionality of the app (creating and editing tasks).
From that point on, the project has been self-guided.

## Features

### Current Features

The user may:
- Create tasks using the '+' button next to the search bar
- Tasks require a title, and can also be given a class tag, due date/time, and description
- Tasks are saved in localStorage between browser sessions

### Upcoming Features

Planned features include:
- Search functionality
- The ability to create and customize classes
- A calendar/task view that can be used to plan ahead

# ClassPlanner

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
